# World Clock Bar

*Three cities, one line.*

## What World Clock Bar is

**World Clock Bar** is a desktop utility. Print the current time in a list of IANA time zones.

A standup across zones should be one command.

Point it at a path, preview the plan if you want, then write the result next to the source or to `--out`.

## How to get it

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## What it does

- Zone list
- One line or table
- Optional seconds
- IANA names

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## CLI

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
